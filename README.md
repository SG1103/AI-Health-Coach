# AI-Health-Coach

The backend of an app developed during a 6-hour hackathon, the AI Health Coach provides users with feedback based on daily images and health-related data.

The AI Health Coach analyzes health metrics, uses the DeepFace library for facial feature identification, and provides feedback, including advice and warnings, based on users' health statuses.


## Description

The AI Health Coach has two primary functionalities:
1. **Data Analysis & Fitness Score Calculation**: Extracts health-related metrics, calculates a fitness score based on these metrics, and uses the DeepFace library to analyze face images for features such as age, gender, race, and emotion.
2. **Health Feedback Generation**: Provides feedback based on the analyzed health metrics, with advice, warnings, and suggestions related to the user's health status.

## Installation

*(Note: Placeholder instructions. Adjust as necessary.)*
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install the required libraries and dependencies.
4. Ensure you have the DeepFace library and any other necessary libraries installed.

## Usage

1. Ensure your health data is updated in `Book1.xlsx`.
2. Input your daily image in the appropriate location.
3. Run the scripts to process the data, analyze the face image, and generate feedback based on the health metrics.
4. Receive AI-generated feedback on your health status, including recommendations and warnings.

## Data

The project uses an Excel data file (`Book1.xlsx`) that contains health-related data for analysis. This data aids the AI in generating accurate feedback.
