# AI-Health-Coach

The backend of an app developed during a 6-hour hackathon, the AI Health Coach provides users with feedback based on daily images and health-related data.

The AI Health Coach analyzes health metrics, uses the DeepFace library for facial feature identification, and provides feedback, including advice and warnings, based on users' health statuses.


The AI Health Coach has two primary functionalities:

Data Analysis & Fitness Score Calculation: Extracts health-related metrics, calculates a fitness score based on these metrics, and uses the DeepFace library to analyze face images for features such as age, gender, race, and emotion.
Health Feedback Generation: Provides feedback based on the analyzed health metrics, with advice, warnings, and suggestions related to the user's health status.
Installation
(Note: Placeholder instructions. Adjust as necessary.)

Ensure you have the DeepFace library and any other necessary libraries installed.
Usage
Ensure your health data is updated in Book1.xlsx.
Input your daily image in the appropriate location.
Run the scripts to process the data, analyze the face image, and generate feedback based on the health metrics.

Data
